## Special Attraction

We would like to come forward to help with Dokra Metal Craft which is situated in Bikna
village in Bankura. We want that people take more of it in future and not to push their
traditional heritage towards extinction. We have seen that most of the people in Bikna village
depend on this for their livelihood and both of their sales and profit margins have decreased a
lot. So, It should be the moral responsibility of every human being to preserve the heritage.
