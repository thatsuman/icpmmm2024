## Kolkata City

Kolkata, one of the biggest cities in India, is a perpetually ongoing festival of human existence, concurrently
luxurious, refined, warm, and futuristic. A vibrant 350-year-old metropolis located on India's Eastern
Coast, the capital of West Bengal thrives on contradictions and imposing spectacles. Kolkata, the City of
Joy, in every sense, is the artistic, cultural and intellectual capital of the country and Kolkata boasts six
Nobel Laureates as their place of birth or work. Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport, about
15km from the city centre, is well connected with other parts of India and abroad as well. Kolkata's streets
are vivid, hectic, and yet, brimming with life and creativity. Driven by the indomitable spirit of the self-
made middle class, the city has created a beautiful juxtaposition of old colonial-era charm with the nascent
upcoming hipster culture that thrives amongst the city's millennial residents. Kolkata has a very lively
nightlife and great street food that is famous all across the country. The city is lined with eateries and food
stalls at every corner, where you can savour traditional Bengali food, or try out local snacks, like, Jhalmuri,
