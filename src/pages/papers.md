## Call for Papers

- ICPMMMM2024 will cover a wide range of themes spanning the entire spectrum of activities related to
  minerals, metals, and materials that are of current and possible future interests to researchers and
  professionals from academia, research, industry, and policy makers. ICPMMM2024 will provide a
  knowledge sharing platform on technological advances and will promote collaborations and dialogues
  among leaders, experts, budding professionals, researchers, and students so that they can utilize the mutual
  strengths to deliberate on challenges and opportunities. The IPCMMM2024 will consist of theme based
  parallel sessions that will be inspiring for the professionals and students through career opportunities,
  technology trends, industry and society needs. The ICPMMM2024 will be structured around a few broad
  verticals, which would appropriately leverage invited & keynote lectures from leading experts in the
  related fields as well as contributory papers presentations. Overall, ICPMMM2024 programme is sure to
  provide the participants an enriching experience. The paper should only be submitted by Email at
  icpmmm2024@gmail.com. <p>
  The conference invites contributions on the following themes but not
  limited to:
