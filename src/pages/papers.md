## Call for Papers

- ICPMMMM2024 will cover a wide variety of themes spanning the entire spectrum of activities related to minerals, metals, materials that are of current interest to researchers and professionals from academia, research and industry. The ICPMMM2024 will provide a knowledge-sharing platform on technological
  advances and will promote collaborations and dialogues among professionals/ researchers so that they can utilize the mutual strengths to deliberate on challenges and opportunities. This IPCMMM2024 will consist of theme based parallel symposia that will be inspiring the professionals and students through
  career opportunities, technology trends and industry needs. The ICPMMM2024 will be structured around a few broad verticals, which would appropriately leverage invited & keynote lectures from leading experts in the field of metallurgical and materials engineering as well as contributory papers presentations.
  Overall, The ICPMMM2024 programme is sure to provide the participants an enriching experience. The paper should only submitted by Email at – (icpmmm2024@gmail.com). The conference invites paper on the following themes but not limited to:
